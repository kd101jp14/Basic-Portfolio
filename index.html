                Hello, my name is Kyra Davis. I am a native to Nashville, and I am on the journey to becoming a web
                developer. I attended Vanderbilt University and graduated in 2014 with a bachelor's in Psychology
                (Research Concentration). After graduating, I spent two years in Gunma, Japan teaching English to junior high
                school students through the JET program.
            </p>

            <p>
                After returning to the United States, I joined a startup tech company called CareZone. Their focus was
                creating an app and website for patients and caregivers to manage their medications. I worked as a Care
                Advisor, assisting patients with issues regarding our servivces. During that time, I worked closely
                with the developers and learned more about what they do. The exposure to our company's developers caused my interest to spark.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently learning coding and full stack development in the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp. It is a
                challenge, but it is also very exciting. There is always so much more to learn and add to my coding toolbox!
