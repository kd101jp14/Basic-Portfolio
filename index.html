                <p>Hello there! I am Kyra. I am a Vanderbilt Full Stack Boot Camp student. I have only just started the
                    course,
                    and
                    I have already learned so much. I enjoy learning about web applications and finding issues in code.</p>

                <p>Before joining this program, I graduated from Vanderbilt University with a degree in Psychology
                    (Research
                    Concentration). After graduating, I took an opportunity to teach English in Japan. Since My time in
                    Japan,
                    I
                    have had the opportunity to work for a startup tech company. There, I worked very closely with
                    developers.
                    I
                    found their job very interesting. However, I was later laid off from working at that startup
                    company
                    when
                    they changed their company structure.</p>

                <p>Due to these recent experiences, I have taken the opportunity to make a career change and become a
                    developer! I am very excited to
                    learn web development and coding at this point in my life. Now, I must balance coding with my other
                    interests,
                    such as cooking, spending time with family, and taking care of my pet turtle!
