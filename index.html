    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello there! I am Kyra. I am a Vanderbilt Full Stack Boot Camp student. This is only my first week of class, and
        I have already learned so much. I enjoy making web pages and finding issues in code.</p>

    <p>Before joining this program, I graduated from Vanderbilt University with a degree in Psychology (Research
        Concentration). After graduating, I took an opportunity to teach English in Japan. Since My time in Japan, I
        have had the opportunity to work for a startup tech company. There, I worked very closly with developers. I
        found their job very
        interesting. However, I was laid off from working at that startup company.</p>

    <p>Due to these recent experiences, I have taken the opportunity to make a career change! I am very excited to
        learn web development and coding at this point in my life. Now, I must balance coding with my other interests,
        such as cooking, reading, and taking care of my pet turtle!
    </p>
